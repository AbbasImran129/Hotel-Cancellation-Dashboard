## 🧭 Process Overview

### **Step 1 — Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicates and handled missing or inconsistent values.  
- Standardized column names and formatted dates for analysis.  
- Filtered out invalid or incomplete booking entries.  
- Ensured numerical and categorical data were properly aligned for pivot analysis.

### **Step 2 — Data Analysis using Pivot Tables**
- Created multiple **Pivot Tables** to explore relationships between:
  - Lead time and cancellation rate  
  - Room type and booking status  
  - Deposit type and customer behavior  
  - Guest type (Single, Couple, Family) and cancellation patterns  
- Used filters, calculated fields, and percentages to make comparisons.

### **Step 3 — Dashboard Creation**
- Designed an interactive Excel **dashboard** combining visuals such as:
  - Bar charts (for cancellations by lead time and room type)  
  - Pie charts (for cancellation distribution by customer type)  
  - Line graphs (for monthly booking and cancellation trends)  
- Added slicers for dynamic filtering (e.g., by hotel type, month, or customer segment).

### **Step 4 — Insight Generation**
- Analyzed the dashboard visuals to identify core issues driving cancellations.  
- Summarized the most influential variables affecting booking outcomes.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **High lead time** bookings (booked far in advance) had the **highest cancellation rates**.  
- **No-deposit** bookings were much more likely to be canceled than prepaid ones.  
- **Repeat guests** were significantly more reliable, showing lower cancellation rates.  
- **Family and couple** bookings showed different behavioral patterns — families tended to book longer stays but canceled more frequently.  
- **Peak seasons** saw higher cancellations, possibly due to overbooking or pricing fluctuations.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how powerful insights can be drawn using only Excel — from raw data to a polished dashboard.  
Through proper cleaning, structured analysis, and visualization, the findings help understand customer behavior and booking patterns, offering a data-driven approach to reduce cancellations.
